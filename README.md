# Real Time AI
Starting recently, I built a simple two dimensional shooting game. The player can move up and down as well as shoot and shield. The objective of this project is to practice implementing a small scale version of a real time video game AI. Currently, the AI consists of a state detection mechanism with several pre-programmed maneuvers to switch contextually based on the situation.
